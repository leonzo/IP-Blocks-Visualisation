# IP Blocks Visualisation

An experiment to try out both [d3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/) and [Cross Filter](http://square.github.com/crossfilter/).

Most of the code is based on and inspired by the Cross Filter [example](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/blob/gh-pages/index.html).

Data is from [Software 77](http://software77.net/geo-ip/) and is great because it's got the date information!

This is totally rough and ready, bug reports, patches and suggestions more than welcome!
